# Graph-Data-with-LLMs-Neo4j-exploration-project-
I used LLM data (from GPT-4) to produce a graph in the Neo4j visual database. Neo4j is a very versatile tool that can use LLM text output as a means of visualization and presentation to understand how LLMs process data (in a graph database format). It displays data using a Node/Edge format, and can be written in Cypher Query Language (similar to SQL). Graph databases (also called NoSQL Databases) have the advantage of having data traversed directly (similar to BFS and DFS, which traverse Binary Trees (inorder, postorder, preorder)) compared to a traditional, tabular SQL database. This can create new opportunities for graph algorithms, which can be modeled for specific systems (and can be even more useful by including AI input within the computational Model). Graph theory and Graph Databases are great alternatives to regular databases, depending on the context of work/scope. Example code and a PDF of the exploration project can be found in this repository.
